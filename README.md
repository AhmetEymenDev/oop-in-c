🚀 C-Style OOP Framework (The Manifesto)
What is this?
This is a lightweight, macro-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOC) framework written in pure C. It bridges the gap between C# discipline and C performance. It implements core OOP concepts like Classes, Methods, Constructors, VTables, and Inheritance without the hidden overhead of C++.

Why use this instead of C++?
Zero Magic: No implicit code generation. You control the memory layout.
Education: It exposes the "black box" of how VTables and this pointers work in high-level languages like C# and Python.
Embedded Ready: Perfect for resource-constrained systems where C++ is too heavy.
NOTE: I developed this at age 14 (Yes, I'm very young right now, but we don't underestimate me) to understand the soul of Software Engineering. It’s not just about code; it’s about how machines handle objects in memory.

🤝 How to Contribute
If you want to improve this OOC Framework, feel free to:
Report Bugs: If the macros fail on specific compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC).
Add Features: Help us implement Multiple Inheritance or Interface Support.
Optimize: Improve the VTable memory footprint for ultra-low-power microcontrollers.
Documentation: Share your own class examples (Physics engines, GUI components, etc.).
